\zsection2[target.ecmascript.translate]{Translation}

Global definitions are translated
such that they are lazily evaluated.
This allows for mutually recursive bindings
as well as non-total bindings.
Laziness is achieved
by overwriting the global
by its value
on the first use.
Hence, using a global
involves calling it
with no arguments.

Translating \zacronym{ANF}
into ECMAScript
proceeds by generating
an ECMAScript variable declaration
for every \zacronym{ANF} binding.

\hyperref[name.mangle]{Name mangling} is applied
to all names
to ensure no trouble is caused
by names that resemble ECMAScript keywords
or violate the lexical rules of ECMAScript.
